# Down is Relative (Minor Skilled)

During this minor, I set out to achieve learning goals, centered around "turning off" default Unity implementation of gravity and physics forces and creating my own based on research of physics puzzle games (Portal, Portal 2, Manifold Garden, TABS, Totally Reliable Delivery Service, Besiege, Teardown, World of Goo, Armadillo Run).

I focused on recreating the Portal mechanic from Portal 1 and 2, the 6-way gravity of Manifold Garden, the surfaces (gel) mechanics of Portal 2, Elastics/Soft-body physics of Armadillo Run and the gameplay loop of World of Goo. The chosen mechanics fit into my self-imposed requirement of the physics mechanic needing to be predictable, discrete and easy to replicate movements across iterations.

Each mechanic had a 2-3 week development cycle with their own test scenes.

The final product is a game, with a few levels that gradually introduce the player to each mechanic. The player must place the physics tools around the level and then run the simulation on the ball.
